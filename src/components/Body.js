                started developing using React. this is my first project
                from my first chapter in the Scrimba React course. Hopefully
                I can use these skills learnt in my upcoming SWE work at
                CashFlow Portal

                I enjoy multiple different things, from reading to video games
                and constantly pick up new hobbies that I would like to try.
                Right now I am working on React in my pasttime as well as doing
                some light reading. I bought stuff to do some embroidery but have
                yet to get around to doing it.
